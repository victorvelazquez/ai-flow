## 🚀 Claude Code Workflow

### Workflow Modes
1. **🚀 Forced Agent Mode:** When running any command starting with `/flow-`, **IMMEDIATELY enter AGENT/EXECUTION MODE**. Do not wait for a general plan approval.
2. **Plan Mode:** Use plan mode for complex *custom* features that are not part of the standard `ai-flow` commands.
3. Break down custom features into small, testable chunks.
4. Get user approval before implementation for custom features.

### Implementation
1. Follow architecture patterns strictly
2. Write tests alongside code
3. Update documentation if behavior changes

## 💡 Claude-Specific Tips

- Use `/flow-build` command for starting documentation generation
- Use plan mode for architectural decisions
- Reference `AGENT.md` for any clarifications
- Ask user before making breaking changes
