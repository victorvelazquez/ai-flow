# /pre-pr-check — Final Quality Review Before Pull Request

> Use this prompt to ensure code and documentation quality before creating a pull request in **{{PROJECT_NAME}}**.

---

## Workflow Steps

Execute each step sequentially. After each step, ask the user if they want to continue to the next one.

### Step 1: Lint & Fix 🔍

Run automatic linting and fix style/code errors.

**Actions:**

- Execute linting tool (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
- Auto-fix correctable issues
- Report remaining warnings/errors

**After completion, ask:** "Continue to Docs Update & Maintenance?"

---

### Step 2: Docs Update & Maintenance 📚

Update main documentation and review for outdated/incomplete sections.

**Actions:**

- Scan for outdated documentation references
- Update README, AGENT.md, and related docs with recent changes
- Suggest improvements for incomplete sections
- Verify links and examples are current

**After completion, ask:** "Continue to Dependency Validation?"

---

### Step 3: Dependency Validation 📦

Check for outdated or vulnerable dependencies and suggest updates.

**Actions:**

- Run `npm outdated` or equivalent
- Check for security vulnerabilities (`npm audit`)
- Suggest safe updates for dependencies
- Flag breaking changes or major version updates

**After completion, ask:** "Continue to Security Checklist?"

---

### Step 4: Security Checklist 🔐

Run a mini security audit (input validation, secrets, permissions, etc.).

**Actions:**

- Verify no hardcoded secrets or API keys in code
- Check input validation on user-facing functions
- Review authentication/authorization implementations
- Scan for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Validate environment variable usage

**After completion, ask:** "Continue to Run Tests?"

---

### Step 5: Run Tests 🧪

Execute all test suites and show coverage report.

**Actions:**

- **Unit Tests:** Execute isolated component/function tests
- **Integration Tests:** Test module interactions and API endpoints
- **E2E Tests:** Run end-to-end user flow scenarios (if applicable)
- **Security Tests:** Verify authentication, authorization, and vulnerability scans
- Generate comprehensive coverage report
- Highlight failed tests or low coverage areas
- Suggest additional test cases if needed
- Verify minimum coverage thresholds are met

**Test Commands (adapt to your project):**
```bash
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e          # E2E tests
npm test                  # All tests
```

**After completion, ask:** "Continue to Conventional Commit?"

---

### Step 6: Conventional Commit 💾

Make an automatic commit with a conventional message based on changes.

**Actions:**

- Analyze changed files
- Generate conventional commit message (feat, fix, docs, chore, etc.)
- Stage and commit changes
- Show commit message for review

**After completion, ask:** "Continue to Summary & PR Suggestion?"

---

### Step 7: Summary & Pull Request Suggestion 📊

Show summary of changes and actions performed.

**Final Output:**

- ✅ List all executed steps
- 📊 Summary of files modified
- 🧪 Test results and coverage stats
- 🔐 Security and dependency check results
- 💾 Commit hash (if committed)

**Pull Request Suggestion:**
If changes were made, suggest:  
"✅ All quality checks passed! Ready to create a pull request to share improvements with the team/community."
