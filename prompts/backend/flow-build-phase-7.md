## PHASE 7: Operations & Deployment (10 min)

> **Order for this phase:** 7.1 → 7.2 → 7.3 → 7.4 → 7.5 → 7.6 → 7.7 → 7.8 → 7.9 → 7.10 → 7.11

> **📌 Scope-based behavior:**
>
> - **MVP:** Ask 7.1-7.4 only (deployment basics), skip 7.5-7.11 (monitoring, scaling, backups), mark as "TBD"
> - **Production-Ready:** Ask 7.1-7.8, simplify 7.9-7.11 (advanced monitoring and scaling)
> - **Enterprise:** Ask all questions 7.1-7.11 with emphasis on reliability and disaster recovery

```
````

**Use for:** Documenting observability strategy, monitoring infrastructure, alerting workflows

---

**Best Practices for Operations Diagrams:**

1. **Include Resource Specs:** Add CPU/RAM/disk info to nodes (e.g., `[API Server<br/>4 vCPU, 8GB RAM]`)
2. **Show Redundancy:** Display load balancers, replicas, multi-AZ deployments, failover paths
3. **Label Network Boundaries:** Use subgraphs for VPCs, subnets, availability zones, regions
4. **Document Protocols:** Label connections with HTTPS, gRPC, TCP, WebSocket, etc.
5. **Add IP Ranges:** Include CIDR blocks for network subnets (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24`)
6. **Show Auto-Scaling:** Indicate which components scale horizontally/vertically
7. **Include External Services:** SaaS tools, third-party APIs, CDNs, email providers
8. **Color Code by Layer:** Infrastructure (blue), data (green), monitoring (purple), alerts (red)

**Common Formatting Rules:**

- Code fence: ` ```mermaid ` (lowercase, no spaces, three backticks)
- Use `subgraph "Name"` to group related components by layer/zone
- Use `[(Cylinder)]` for databases, data stores, and persistent storage
- Use `[Square Brackets]` for services, servers, and compute resources
- Use dotted arrows `-.->` for replication, backup, and async flows
- Apply consistent styling: `style NodeName fill:#colorcode`

**Deployment Context Examples:**

- For Docker: Show containers, volumes, networks, registries
- For Kubernetes: Show pods, services, ingress, namespaces, persistent volumes
- For Serverless: Show Lambda functions, API Gateway, S3 triggers, event sources
- For VMs: Show instances, security groups, load balancers, auto-scaling groups

**Validation:** Test diagrams at https://mermaid.live/ before saving to ensure syntax is correct

- 📄 Generate README.md (with intelligent merge if needed)
- 🤖 Create tool-specific configs (based on AI selection)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** README.md MUST NOT exist yet. It will be generated in Phase 8 step 8.5 AFTER framework initialization to avoid conflicts.

Continue to Phase 8? (yes/no)

## EXECUTION CHECKLIST FOR AI ASSISTANT

When executing this master prompt:

**PHASE 0 (Existing Projects Only):**

- [ ] Check if project has existing code/documentation
- [ ] Search for AI instruction files (copilot-instructions.md, .clauderules, .cursorrules, AGENT.md, etc.)
- [ ] Search for README.md, package.json, and config files
- [ ] **Perform deep code analysis:**
  - [ ] Recursively scan source directories (src/, app/, lib/, modules/)
  - [ ] Count files by type (controllers, services, entities, DTOs, etc.)
  - [ ] Identify architecture pattern (feature-based, layer-based, modular, hybrid)
  - [ ] **Parse source code files for AST-based analysis:**
    - [ ] Detect decorators (@Controller, @Get, @Post for NestJS; @app.get() for FastAPI)
    - [ ] Extract API endpoints (method, path, parameters, middleware)
    - [ ] Identify services and dependency injection patterns
    - [ ] Detect error handling patterns
  - [ ] **Analyze database schemas:**
    - [ ] Parse Prisma schema.prisma (models, relationships, indexes)
    - [ ] Parse TypeORM entities (@Entity, @Column, relationships)
    - [ ] Parse SQLAlchemy models
    - [ ] Extract complete entity definitions with fields and relationships
  - [ ] **Analyze dependencies:**
    - [ ] Extract exact versions from package.json/requirements.txt/etc.
    - [ ] Identify framework, ORM, validation, auth, testing libraries
    - [ ] Detect security-related packages
  - [ ] **Detect code patterns:**
    - [ ] Dependency injection usage
    - [ ] Error handling implementation
    - [ ] Validation patterns (DTOs, schemas)
    - [ ] Logging setup
    - [ ] Testing configuration
    - [ ] Caching strategies
    - [ ] Background job systems
- [ ] Present detailed detection results (0.2) including:
  - [ ] Architecture pattern detected
  - [ ] Complete list of API endpoints with details
  - [ ] All entities with schemas and relationships
  - [ ] Dependencies with versions
  - [ ] Code quality indicators
- [ ] **Generate proactive suggestions (0.2.1):**
  - [ ] Analyze code for security gaps (validation, rate limiting, CORS, etc.)
  - [ ] Identify architecture improvements
  - [ ] Detect documentation gaps
  - [ ] Suggest testing improvements
  - [ ] Recommend performance optimizations
  - [ ] Present suggestions with actions and impacts
- [ ] **Offer export option (0.3):**
  - [ ] Ask if user wants to export analysis to JSON
  - [ ] If yes, create .ai-flow/analysis.json with complete analysis
- [ ] Let user choose: A) Use detected info, B) Start fresh, C) Review/edit detected info
- [ ] **Handle suggestions:**
  - [ ] If user selected A (address during build), integrate suggestions into relevant phases
  - [ ] If user selected B (save for later), create suggestions.md file
  - [ ] If user selected C (skip), continue without changes
- [ ] Pre-populate answers based on detected information
- [ ] Mark questions that still need answers

**PHASES 1-7 (All Projects):**

- [ ] Execute phases 1-7 in exact order
- [ ] **SKIP questions already answered** from Phase 0 detection (existing projects)
- [ ] Ask remaining questions ONE BY ONE (wait for answer)
- [ ] Wait for user response before proceeding
- [ ] Provide recommendations (⭐🔥⚡🏆)
- [ ] Offer multiple choice where applicable
- [ ] Summarize each phase for confirmation
- [ ] Collect ALL required information
- [ ] Generate documents **incrementally** after each phase
- [ ] Ask for user validation after each document generation
- [ ] Re-read generated documents at start of each new phase
- [ ] Perform final checkpoint before generating AGENT.md and README.md
- [ ] Re-read ALL documents before final generation to ensure accuracy
- [ ] Use templates from `.ai-flow/templates/`
- [ ] Create tool-specific configs based on AI selection
- [ ] Validate no placeholders remain
- [ ] Provide clear next steps

**DO NOT:**

- ❌ Skip Phase 0 detection for existing projects
- ❌ Skip deep code analysis - always perform comprehensive AST-based parsing when code exists
- ❌ Present superficial analysis - include detailed endpoints, entities, and patterns
- ❌ Ignore proactive suggestions - always generate and present improvement opportunities
- ❌ Ask questions already answered by detected files or code analysis
- ❌ Ignore existing AI instruction files
- ❌ Skip questions or phases
- ❌ Assume answers without asking (when info is not detected)
- ❌ Generate ALL documents at the end (generate incrementally!)
- ❌ Skip document validation after generation
- ❌ Forget to re-read documents before using their info
- ❌ Generate final documents without re-reading all previous docs
- ❌ Leave placeholder text in final documents
- ❌ Skip exporting analysis JSON if user requested it
- ❌ Rush through the analysis - thoroughness saves time later

**ESTIMATED TIME:**

**New Projects:**

- Phase 1: 15-20 min
- Phase 2: 15-20 min
- Phase 3: 15-20 min
- Phase 4: 15-20 min
- Phase 5: 15-20 min
- Phase 6: 10 min
- Phase 7: 10 min
- **Total: 90-120 minutes**

**Existing Projects (with Phase 0 detection):**

- Phase 0: 10-20 min (deep code analysis + suggestions + review)
  - File detection: 2-3 min
  - Deep code analysis (AST parsing, schema extraction): 5-10 min
  - Generating suggestions: 2-3 min
  - User review and export: 1-4 min
- Phases 1-7: 30-60 min (only missing questions)
- **Total: 40-80 minutes** (40-60% time saved!)

This is an investment that will save 10-20 hours over the project lifecycle.

**EXECUTION FLOW:**

1. **START:** User runs `/flow-build`
2. **DETECT:** Check for existing project files (Phase 0)
   - If existing files found → Run Phase 0 deep analysis:
     - 0.1: Deep Code Analysis (file structure, AST parsing, schema extraction, pattern detection)
     - 0.2: Present Detailed Detection Results (architecture, endpoints, entities, dependencies, code quality)
     - 0.2.1: Generate Proactive Suggestions (security, architecture, documentation, testing, performance)
     - 0.3: Export Analysis Results (optional JSON export)
     - 0.4: Load Existing Context (pre-populate answers)
   - If no files found → Skip to Phase 1
3. **EXECUTE:** Run Phases 1-7 with pre-populated answers (if any)
   - Integrate suggestions from Phase 0 into relevant phases if user selected option A
4. **GENERATE:** Create documents incrementally with validation
5. **COMPLETE:** Final checkpoint and remaining documents

**BEGIN EXECUTION when user runs `/flow-build`**
